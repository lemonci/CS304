QuickSort

- worst case O(n^2): unbalanced partition
- average sort of O(n logn)

Divide: Partition the array A[g..r] into two possibily empty subarrays A[p..q-1], A[q+1..r] such that each element of A[p..q-1] is less than or equal to A[q] , which is in turn <= A[q+1..r] 
Conquer: sort two subarrays A[p..q-1], A[q+1..r] by recursive calls to quicksort
Combine: not needed

def quicksort(A, p, r):
	if p < r:
		q = partition(A, p, r)
		quicksort(A, p, q)
		quicksort(A, q+1, r)

def partition(A, p, r):
	i = random(p, r)	# Randomized quicksort
	exchange A[r], A[i]
	x = A[r]
	i = p - 1
	for j in range(p, r):
		if A[j] <= x:
			i += 1
			temp = A[i]
			A[i] = A[j]
	temp = A[r]
	A[r] = A[i+1]
	A[i+1] = temp
	
	return i

But on average, quicksort is quicker than merge sort because merge sort takes more time per procedure.

Proof the lower (Omega) of any comparison-based sorting algorithm is nlogn:
Any compasison-based sort can be treated as a binary tree.

def insertion_sort(1, len(arr)):
	for i in range(1, len(arr)):
		elem = arr[i]
		j = i - 1
		while j > -1 and arr[j] > elem:
			arr [j + 1] = arr[j]
			j - = 1
		arr[j+1] = elem

(0)a_1 : a_2?
(1a) <=	Yes
(1b) >

(1)a_2 : a_3?
(2a) <=
(2b) > Yes

(2)a_1 : a_3?
(2a) <= 
(2b) > Yes -> a_3, a_1, a_2

The maximum height of the decision tree:
Theorem: Any comparison-based sort requires Omega(n log n) comparisions in worst case.
Proof: consider decision tree of height h with l reachable leaves corresponding to comparison sort of n elements because of n! permutations appears as some leaf we have n! < l, since a binary tree of height h has no more than 2^n leaves.
we have n! <= l <= 2^h
h >= log(n!) = Theta(n log(n))

Counting sort: O(n) non-comparison based sort assume input A[1..n] of integers for each element x, count the number of elements less than x.
# a stable sort: element with the same value will remain the original sequence.

def counting_sort(A, B, k):
	C = [0] * k
	for j in range(len(A)):
		C[A[j]=C[A[j]]+1
	for i in range(1, k):
		C[i] = C[i] + C[i-1]
	for j in range(len(A)-1, -1, -1):
		B[C[A[j]]]-1] = A[j]
		C[A[j]] = C[A[i]]-1
