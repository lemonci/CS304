infix: 6 * ( 5 + ( 2 + 3 ) * 8 + 3 ) = 288
postfix: 6 5 2 3 + 8 * + 3 + * = 288
Evaluation postfix expr: using stack
	read expr from left to right
		if operand, push to stack
		if operator, pop two values off stack
			perform operations
			push result back on stack

infix: a + b * c + ( d * e + f) * g
postifx: a b c * + d e * f + g * +
Algorithm for converting infix to postfix:
	1) if operand, plate in output
	2) if we encounter an operator, place on stack, also stack left parathesis
	3) if we encounter a right parathesis, pop stack and write symbols until we encounter corresponding left parathesis
	4) if we see any other symbol, such as +, *, '(' we pop entries from stack until we find an entry of lower priority
	5) when the popping is done, push operator to stack
	6) if at end, pop entire stack and write to output
